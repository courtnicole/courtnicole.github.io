### Magic Leap  
**Graduate Research Fellow**  
*Product Research & Development*  
*July 2021 - September 2021*  

I collaborated on existing research projects to provide knowledge of qualitative experiment design and best principles for interaction in AR spaces. I helped develop and conduct critical usability and user experience studies.  

### RSM
**Contract Consultant**  
*Technology Sales & Consulting*  
*December 2019*  

I provided expertise in implementing the 3D capture and modeling of reflective objects for display in AR. I developed an initial 3D scan using data from a Microsoft Kinect; subsequently, I developed a final model with photogrammetric captures and Autodesk ReCap. The resulting model was displayed in the Hololens by Priority Bicycles at NRF’s “Big Show” in January 2020.  

### Army Research Lab
**Graduate Research Intern**  
*Object Detection & Recognition Lab*  
*June 2018 - August 2018*  

I improved an existing mission planning sandtable prototype for the Hololens 1 with the goal of improving collaboration capabilities and data visualization. My direct contributions included implementing multi-user capabilities for co-located collaborators, and developing affordances for shared examination and markup of drone-captured terrain data.

### PlayStation
**Graduate Intern**  
*Magic Lab, Research & Development*  
*June 2017 - August 2017*  

I experimented with proprietary technology as part of research exploration. During a collaboration with Sony Music Group and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, I developed and implemented experimental user interfaces for virtual reality. As part of this work, I implemented a SQLite database in Unity.
